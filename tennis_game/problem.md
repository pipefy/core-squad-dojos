# Tennis Game

## Problem Description

Write a program to control the score of a tennis game. These are the rules for the
score system:

1. Each player can have either of these points in one game: `0, 15, 30, 40`

1. If you have `40` and you score you win the game, however there are special
   rules.

Special rules:

1. If both have `40` the players are `deuce`.

1. If the game is in `deuce`, the player who scores take `advantage`.

1. If the game is in `deuce` and the player with `advantage` scores he `wins` the game.

1. If the game is in `deuce` and the player without `advantage` scores the game is
   back at `deuce`.
